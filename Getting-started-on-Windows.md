## UPDATE (Beta Release)

We now have a 1-click installer for Windows that provides some native integration, we suggest using that. Please download from [our website](https://www.mailpile.is/download/)

However, if you want to help develop Mailpile by submitting pull requests that would be awesome. We need to create documentation about how to best setup a dev version of Mailpile in Windows.

### Old notes

Download links used to resolve dependencies:

    python 2.7: <http://www.python.org/download/>
    lxml: <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml>
    pyreadline: <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyreadline/2.0>

There is a windows-equivalent to "mp" in the root directory. This should
match the behavior of the existing "mp" assuming the user installed python
2.7 in the default installation location.
