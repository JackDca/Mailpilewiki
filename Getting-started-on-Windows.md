Windows support is currently incomplete.

Download links used to resolve dependencies:

    python 2.7: <http://www.python.org/download/>
    lxml: <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml>
    pyreadline: <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyreadline/2.0>

There is a windows-equivalent to "mp" in the root directory. This should
match the behavior of the existing "mp" assuming the user installed python
2.7 in the default installation location.
