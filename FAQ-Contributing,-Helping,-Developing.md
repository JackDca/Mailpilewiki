### I am a developer, how can I help?

Take a look at our [Github page](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile), we have a very long list of open issues.

### I am not a techie, how can I help?

You can spread the word about the awesomeness of Mailpile! 

You can [give us lots of money](https://www.mailpile.is/donate/)! Or just a little bit, it all helps.

When we release new versions of the software (there have been a few Alpha and Beta releases already), it is useful for us to get feedback on what works well and what does not. However, note that *at the moment* we have literally hundreds of outstanding issues and are a bit swamped. As we make progress and fix the obvious things, getting reports about edge cases or things we haven't yet encountered will become more and more important.

### Do you accept Bitcoin?

Yes. If you don't want to be anonymous you'll have to get in touch to let us know who to thank!
