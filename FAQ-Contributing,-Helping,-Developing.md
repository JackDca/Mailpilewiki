### I am a developer, how can I help?

You can take a look at our Github page and figure out if there's something to do there. 

### I am not a techie, how can I help?

You can spread the word about the awesomeness of Mailpile! 

### Hi guys, I think your project is awesome, can we work together on something? I would like to work with/for you guys for my super cool project!

We're happy that you have a super cool project and that you think our project is awesome. Right now, we are working very hard on getting Mailpile up and running and we are not looking for getting involved in extra projects as that would take time!

### Can I be an official backer, with the stated reward, if I pay with Bitcoin?

You can be an official backer even if you don't pay with Bitcoin!

### Will you send me your IBAN and BIC code and name and address, so I can send you a financial support by bank?

Yes. At some point.

### I want to be a beta tester.

Excellent! Beta release is planned for the end of July 2014. Stay tuned!
