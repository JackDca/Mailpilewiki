# A pile of ideas

These are random ideas that may or may not make sense.  Most of them
were in one way or another inspired by conversations at FSCONS 2011/2012.


## Power user features

Done?

   * Fast for large amounts of e-mail
   * Powerful searching
   * Powerful filters
   * GPG encryption: mail and/or local data
   * Reply all, reply many, forwarding, bouncing

Ideas:

   * Sticky search: checked messages stay in the list
   * GPG indexing: automatic or manual
   * Multiple personalities for composing: name/email/gpg/sig/template
   * Personal mailing lists: if UI is public, allow direct unsubscribe
   * Schedule messages for sending later
   * Built-in web-bug support to know who has read what and when
   * Revokable mail: send an URL, display message in browser.
   * Multimedia composing
   * Collaborative composing
   * Google Translate integration
   * Ability to drop messages from the search index? (Delete)
   * Facebook/Gravatar integration for photos?
   * Jabber transport to snag Facebook messages? Facebook app?
   * Markdown!


## Tahoe-LAFS integration

Once a significant amount of e-mail has been indexed, tagged and sorted,
losing the index becomes a serious problem.

Backing up is the obvious solution (and not necessarily Mailpile's problem),
but it would be interesting to explore the option of integrating with
Tahoe-LAFS to provide "out of the box" secure distributed storage.

... but it would probably be too slow.  An alternative, now that mailpile
knows how to GPG encrypt/decrypt things, is to add unhosted support or
webdav.  That might get us Tahoe-LAFS for free anyway?


## Remote sources and sync

Mailpile currently recognizes duplicate messages by Message-ID, and assumes
that discovering a duplicate within the same mailbox means the message has
been edited/moved.

It silently ignores duplicates found in other mailboxes, which is probably
not great behavior, instead it should probably track all locations for a
message (update: this has been fixed).

This in turn implies a backup/sync option: Mailpile could enforce a policy
of all messages always existing in multiple mailboxes OR a simpler policy
where one mailbox always mirrors the others.

This in turn leads to questions about versioning, which is a big topic...


## Collaboration and access controls

If tags are given an "access control" characteristic, Mailpile's web
interface could be useful for:

   * Collaboration on mail
   * Support / Forums
   * Instant mailing list archives
   * Blogging and comments


## RSS integration

Reading mail and reading RSS are really similar.  Indexing RSS feeds
would be kinda awesome.

However - once we start indexing other peoples' content we quickly end
up with an order of magnitude more data and the index-in-RAM strategy
may become untenable.  It's like busy mailing lists, only worse.


## Searching other things

It's a search engine.  It could search the web, but more realistically
it might be useful as a super-bookmarking tool which indexes arbitrary
pages on demand.  We'd want a mirroring feature to go with this though.

We should be able to index the chat logs from e.g. Pidgin/Purple.


## Fighting spam

Training a Bayes filter would ideally be done automatically:

   - Replying to a message can be treated as a relatively strong
     indicator that a message is not spam - could lead to
     auto-whitelisting of the sender.

   - Archiving a message or tagging is a weak indicator that a message
     is not spam.

   - Flagging as spam trains the spam filter.

Do we want to implement the mailer fingerprinter?

PageKite allows us to use the web:

   - Folks could submit e-mail using web forms instead of SMTP, where
     anti-comment-spam tech can be used to avoid spam.

   - Borderline spam could potentially get auto-replies directing
     senders to an annoying "prove you are human" form.

Combining Mailpile and PageKite, means mail clients can start talking
to each-other.  Could this be useful for fighting spam?

   - Marking mail AS SPAM or as NOT SPAM could be shared anonymously
     with peers, via. hashes.

   - Reputation information could be shared as well.  But with friends
     only, as it will inevitably leak who you are communicating with?
     The benefit is a potential friends-of-friends whitelist for preventing
     false-positives and allowing spam filters to be more aggressive.
