### Which device would you recommend for us to use to enable maximum privacy? 

This question might take a while to answer. In the meantime, check out Security In a Box. It's a good start!

### Guys  you do a great job while creating such a prominent service. In fact, I  thought about the same thing for Russian market. Do you think that I  could resell your service in Russia?

Feel free!

### I  heard you guys may be releasing the Alpha build around the beginning of  2014 and was just wondering if it was going to be an open Alpha? Will we be allowed to install, use, and give feed back around that time?

Absolutely. The Alpha release will require a bit of tech knowledge and use the command line to get up and running. The beta (April 2014) will be much easier.
