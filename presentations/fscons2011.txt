      What is FOSS hackers' favorite proprietary program?


                        Is it GMail?


                   Dunno, but it is mine!

    Mailpile is a fast personal searching, indexing and
    tagging tool for e-mail.

    It is fast fast fast fast!

    It is new.


                    It wants: A web interface
                              To cure my GMail addiction
                              <your desires here>







   Mailpile is: 2 weeks old
                1424 lines of Python
                AGPLv3 licensed



        Mailpile searches my 80093 e-mails, sorts the
        results and displays them, in about 400ms.

        Running `wc` on a small file also takes 400ms.

       





              Mailpile has a roadmap:           


   :)  1. Write indexing and searching engine.

   :)  2. GMail-style conversation threading, tags and filters.

       3. Create an XML-RPC API, build an ugly web UI.

       4. Get help!  Convince HTML/JS gurus to build a nice UI.

       5. Iterate until awesome.
