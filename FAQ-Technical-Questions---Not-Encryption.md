### Will Mailpile run on Windows 8.1, Mac OSX, Linux etc. etc.?

Yes.

### Will mail sent from Mailpile be compatible with other e-mail clients?

Yes! We are compliant with all the appropriate internet and e-mail standards.

### Does Mailpile offer e-mail server hosting?

We don't offer that at the moment. We might in the future. Others currently do.

### Will there be support for importing from Thunderbird, Outlook, Mac Mail, Eudora, etc...?

We already support importing data from various common formats. We're going to try and support all the popular formats over time.

### Can I migrate my mail from one server to Mailpile?

Yes, but note that Mailpile is not a mail server - you're still going to have to have one of those somewhere - Mailpile is an email client.

### When signing up to websites using this email service, would my email address show up within the company I signed up to?

That will depend on how the service you signup on has implemented Mailpile. Our software allows people to keep/use their existing addresses.

### I  don't want my email to be full of illegal content (child porn) or viruses, how will you make that is possible? (Does the system scan for malware and remove them or at least warn us of suspect attachments).

You should probably run anti-virus software on your computer - Mailpile won't have that. We will provide a spam filter, which can be configured to keep out some nasty stuff. But realistically, all filters are flawed. In particular, it is very very hard to explain to a computer what is illegal - pretty much impossible. Humans are always going to have to exercise some level of good judgement.

### Can you disable SPAM when using this server?

We will provide a spam filter. "Disabling spam" is a high bar - but we will do what we can as well as provide tools you can use to manually filter.

### Can I install Mailpile on my dedicated server at OVH with Cent OS?

Sure! We like acronyms!

### Will it run on Raspberry Pi? There are RPi collocation services that are promising.

Yes! Mailpile can run on Linux. Linux can run on Raspberry Pi. Therefore... we look forward to seeing people experiment with this, actually.

### Could you maybe leave in the possibility in Mailpile to manually download the font and plug it into the installation?

We made our own font. It's bundled with Mailpile! Yay!

### Will Mailpile  work on PowerPC / ARM architecture (I'm thinking of my Bubba 2 or future Bubba 3) since Mailpile is webmail. Would there be any issues for that with the necessary encryption libs / modules?

You won't have any problems. Mailpile is written in Python, so it's very portable.

### Will Mailpile change the Mail DNS server settings?

No, Mailpile is a mail client - if you want to update your DNS, you'll have to do it through your registrar.

### So with Mailpile will I be able to overcome my ISP mail limitations?

Mailpile is not an email server, so our software will not be able to help you achieve this goal.

### What about Linux? Are you coding Mailpile for Linux as well?

Two of our three core developers do everything on Linux. We're not even entirely sure how to use all those other OS's... ;)

### I have a super specific request how I'd like my email to be. Can you implement it?!

Not right now, maybe in the future. We are just three guys trying to get a beta ready in the summertime, but it's open source so you can play with it too!

### My friend just  said he'll use it if you have push support (probably  through an  exchange emulation, like how google apps has it).

We like this idea, and we would like to implement it at some point, but it's not on our current roadmap.

### Will you support multiple email accounts, not multiple user accounts (different people), this is multiple email accounts for one person.

Yes, this feature is in development.

### Will messages be sent via SMTP from my regular address?

Yes, absolutely, Mailpile is an email client that inter-operates with the standard email protocol SMTP.
