### Will Mailpile run on Windows 8.1, Mac OSX, Linux etc. etc.?

Mailpile 1.0 should run on Linux, Mac OS X and modern versions of Windows.

### Will mail sent from Mailpile be compatible with other e-mail clients?

Yes! We are compliant with all the appropriate internet and e-mail standards.

### Can Mailpile import from Thunderbird, Outlook, Mac Mail, Eudora, etc...?

We already support importing data from various common formats and aim to try and support all the popular formats over time.

### Will Mailpile protect me from spam? Illegal content? Viruses?

Mailpile's spam filter will stop most such problems from reaching your inbox. However, no spam filter is perfect and we cannot guarantee you will never see unwanted or unpleasant e-mails.

In either case, we recommend using an up-to-date anti-virus solution and keeping your operating system and web browser fully up to date with the latest security updates.

Please also see our [Security Roadmap](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/wiki/Security-roadmap) for more details on how we plan to deal with malicious content in the future.

### Will Mailpile run on Raspberry Pi?

Yes, most certainly. Mailpile runs on most Linux systems.

### Will Mailpile work on PowerPC? ARM? Intel?

You won't have any problems. Mailpile is written in Python, so it's very portable.

### Will Mailpile support multiple email accounts?

Yes, you can use more than one e-mail account at once with Mailpile, both to receive mail and send.

### I run a server! Can I can use Mailpile to give my users webmail access?

Note that Mailpile is primarily written as a personal application, it is not designed for large multi-user installations.

That said, this should become possible for small groups quite soon after our 1.0 release. Mostly we will need to document the recommended setup procedure.
