### Will there be Open Source Smileys/Emoticons available in Mailpile?

We haven't discussed that, so no. However, it is an open source project so if you want to make emoticons then you can.

### Do you have any plans to implement threaded conversations, like gmail? 

Yes, this is currently implemented. However, our design is slightly more "conversation" style that single line snippets.

### How do we make it easy enough for our elders to use?

We will do our best to grandma proof everything in Mailpile.

### Will there be any similarities to Eudora?

None of our team are Eudora users, but we strive to provide all the features popular email clients have.

### I don't find many programs that exist well in both the Windows and the Mac worlds. How do you plan to deliver this experience?

Mailpile runs inside a web browser using HTML, CSS, and Javascript which 99% of the time is identical on both Mac and Windows. 

### PGP encryption should be made simple. Does Mailpile's interface do this?

Yes! That is our goal :)

### Will Mailpile inform users if an email they received was encrypted or not?

Yes, Mailpile currently does this, as well as emails that are partially encrypted.

### Will the composing interface make it easy to choose whether I want to encrypt or not encrypt an email?

Yes, we have a put a lot of time into thinking about and designing this to be intuitive.

### Is installing Mailpile going to be a simple double-click icon that once installed just opens a browser and loads Mailpile?

Yes, that is the goal. Perhaps even a headless instance of a web kit that runs separately on your normal browser.

### Why isn't there more access to PGP encryption via the web interface?

This is an alpha release. We are definitely going to expose more of our PGP encryption interface to the web user interface like adding, signing and deleting of keys as well as other things. Development is in progress.

### I do not want automatically grouped conversations. I cannot track this way. Does your program do that too?

The conversations are threaded, but we are considering if we will change that in the future.

### I love your mail client do you know its cpanel ready?

We are currently quite far from having a cpanel, but we plan to have it in the future. At the moment we are working hard on our Beta which is planned for this summer.
