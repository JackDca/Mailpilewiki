### Do you have any plans to implement threaded conversations? Like GMail? 

Mailpile's default conversation view is very similar to that of GMail, with messages grouped together in chronological order.

Other threading strategies might be added later.

### How will Mailpile exist well in both the Windows and the Mac worlds?

Mailpile runs inside a web browser using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the user interface. This provides an experience which is both familiar and very similar no matter what operating system they use.

### Does Mailpile make PGP encryption simple?

Yes! That is our goal at any rate. :-)

### Will Mailpile inform users if an e-mail they received was encrypted or not?

Yes. Messages are annotated with icons illustrating both encryption state and whether a message was signed or not. More detailed context-appropriate explanations are available in tooltips.

### Will the composer make it easy to choose whether I want to encrypt or not?

Yes, we have a put a lot of time into thinking about and designing this to be intuitive.

### How hard will it be to install Mailpile?

It should simply be a double-click to launch an installer on Windows, or dragging an app to the Applications folder on the Mac.

On Linux we hope to provide native packages for most of the popular distributions.
