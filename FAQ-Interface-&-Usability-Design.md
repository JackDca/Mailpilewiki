### Will there be Open Source Smilies/Emoticons available in MailPile?

We haven't discussed that, so no. However, it is an open source project so if you want to make emoticons then you can.

### Do you have any plans to implement threaded conversations, like gmail? 

Yes, this is currently implemented. However, our design is slightly more "conversation" looking that single line snippets.

### How  do we make it easy enough for our elderly parents to use?

We will do our best to grandma proof everything in Mailpile. That'll of course take years of experimenting and 

### Will there be any similarities to Eudora?

None of our team are Eudora users, but we strive to provide all the features popular email clients have.

### I don't find many programs that exist well in both the Windows and the Mac worlds. How do you plan to deliver this experience?

Mailpile runs inside a web browser using HTML, CSS, and Javascript which 99% of the time is identical on both Mac and Windows. 

### PGP should be made simple. Does Mailpile's interface do this?

Yes. That is our goal :)

### Will the interface inform users if an email they received was encrypted or not?

Yes, our interface currently does this, as well as emails that are partially encrypted.

### Will the composing interface make it easy to choose weather I want to encrypt or not encrypt an email?

Yes, we have a put a lot of time into thinking about and designing this to be intuitive.

### Is installation going to be a simple double click icon that once installed just opens a browser and loads mailpile?

Yes, that is the goal. Perhpas even a headless instance of webkit that runs separately than your normal browser.
