### Is Mailpile real?

Yes, and so are we!

### Is Mailpile ready yet?

We launched an Alpha version for developers and advanced techies on Feb 1st 2014. A more user friendly Beta should be ready by late spring. Our 1.0 release will be in late summer 2014. For further details, check out our [blog](https://mailpile.is/blog/).

### Can we use Mailpile as the standard mail solution for our clients/company/server?

When Mailpile is ready, that should be an option, yes.

### How can I get a MailPile account?

There is no such thing! Mailpile is software you run on you computer, not an e-mail service provider. So you can just use the e-mail addresses you have already, or sign up for a new one somewhere.

### Can I still Donate?

Yes we would love for you to [support us](https://mailpile.is/donate/)

### Is Mailpile always going to be free?

Yes, it is a free and open software. However, to live in the current global economy, one has to have money to exchange for food. If you like it, [please consider donating](https://mailpile.is/donate/).

### Is there a mailing list so I can follow on your work?

Not yet, but this is a good idea! We will think about it.

### How to get updates from your project?

We have an IRC channel on Freenode, #mailpile. There it is easiest to get hold un us and ask questions. Otherwise you can follow us on Twitter. Maybe in the future we'll consider having a emaiiasdsdst

### One thought I had though was regarding accessibility, what happens when my computer is offline?

When the computer (laptop, desktop, webserver) you run your Mailpile from is offline, your Mailpile instance is no longer usable.
