WAT? Mailpile is an amazing email client made with much love, care, and awesomeness- why would you ever want to uninstall Mailpile? Well, OK, we are still a little rough around the edges. For example, we have not even had a proper beta release yet.

To uninstall Mailpile do the following:

* Delete your main `Mailpile` folder, you know the thing that downloaded from Github
* Delete your `.mailpile` folder, it lives in your home directory.
    * On *nix system that is usually `/home/username/.mailpile`
    * On a Mac that is `/Users/username/.mailpile`
    * On a Windows... not really sure
