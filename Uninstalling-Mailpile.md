WAT? Mailpile is an amazing email client made with much love, care, and awesomeness- why would you ever want to uninstall Mailpile? Well, OK, we are still a little rough around the edges. For example, we have not even had a proper beta release yet. So, if you want to delete your install we understand

## Uninstalling on Windows


## Uninstalling on MacOS


## Uninstalling on Linux


## Uninstalling manually

To uninstall Mailpile do the following:

* Delete your main `Mailpile` folder, you know the thing that downloaded from Github
* Delete your `.mailpile` folder, it lives in your home directory.
    * On *nix system that is usually `/home/username/.local/share/Mailpile`
    * On a Mac that is `/Users/username/.mailpile`
    * On a Windows `C:\Documents\Users\username\.mailpile`

Be warned, deleting the `.mailpile` folder will delete any mail that was sent from your Mailpile

Well, so long and thanks for all the fish. We hope you'll stop by again and give us a try once we are a little more finished ;)
