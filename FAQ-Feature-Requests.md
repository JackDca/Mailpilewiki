### Are you going to include incoming filtering of messages to specific folders? 

Yes, we use "Tags" instead of folders, but they function similarly. We also have a filters feature that works with Tags.

### Is there the an ability to synchronize contact information with an external contact manager like Google contacts?

We will support importing of contacts from Google Contacts, but not synchronizing back to Google. However, someone may make a plugin to do so.

### Will there be POP and IMAP support?

Yes. Soon.

### Will there be an app for Android?

Not yet, no. But in the future yes.

### Will there be an app for iPhone / iPad?

Perhaps, but we are not excited about Apple's App Store policies as well as their known involvement with the NSA.

### I'd like to write a Mailpile app... Can I do that?

Sure you can. But realize that you're writing with pre-alpha code or alpha code.

### I want an inbox that allows messages in and out from many different sources - email, SMS, voicemail, facebook, twitter, etc.

We think this is REALLY cool, hopefully our community will help us make awesome plugins that make this a reality faster!

### For the Linux / Unix geeks, like me, will there be command line utilities or interface?

Yes, absolutely, this currently exists as much of our team of Linux / Unix geeks.

### Can I interact with Mailpile via XML-RPC?

Maybe.

### Do you provide support for SMTP?

Yes, this is currently implemented.

### Make sure users can set different SMTP ports for outgoing mail as most ISPs block port 25

Users can specify this from the "Settings" interface.

### Make users should be allowed to choose rather or not SSL is enabled. SSL should be either a self signed key which Mailpile makes, or a key the user provides.

This is a great idea. We will hopefully implement features for SSL like this once we get further a long :)

### Make it easy to provide a configuration file with the SSL certificate for iOS

We are not sure how much we want to develop towards supporting Apple's heavily walled (and surveilled) garden, but consider accessing a mobile web app of Mailpile served from a Raspberry Pi on an iOS device

### Can I choose to have Mailpile delete the email from the original server after download or keep it.

Yes, once POP & IMAP is implemented we will support this feature.

### Have the option to auto port forward using NAT-PMP/UPnP and possibly offer a free DNS record on mailpile.is that is used as a dynamic DNS so users can access their mail by going to mrgecko.mailpile.is as an example.

This is an interesting idea that we are considering.

### Will Mailpile do automatic mail wiping?

Inbox zero is a noble goal. Is that what you meant? We hope to encourage & work on plugins to achieve this goal.

### Any plans to provide secure email accounts similar to what Lavabit did?

No plans to do what Lavabit did as they were a centralized solution. Decentralization is one of our main end goals. We are considering offering services (relays, servers) that make the sending of email more secure + allow for decentralization + are sustainable + user friendly.
