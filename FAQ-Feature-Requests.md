### Can Mailpile filter incoming messages to specific folders? 

Mailpile uses Tags instead of folders. They function similarly, except a single message can have many different tags applied.

Filters can be defined which apply tags to incoming mail automatically.

### Can Mailpile synchronize contact information with an external contact manager like Google contacts?

Not yet.

### Will there be POP, IMAP and SMTP support?

Yes!

### Will there be an app for Android?

Not right away, no. But hopefully some day.

### Will there be an app for iPhone / iPad?

Not right away, no. But hopefully some day.

### For the Linux / Unix geeks, will there be a command line interface?

Mailpile has a text-based interface which can be used in a terminal, in addition to the web-based user interface. There is also support for automation and scripting, but it is mostly at the Python level, not in the shell.

### What about backups?

This is not fully decided, but we do recognize that if users are to download their mail from the cloud and entrust it to Mailpile, then Mailpile will need to help make sure backups are in place and kept up to date.

We are considering ideas such as encrypting data and re-uploading to IMAP servers in order to implement secure off-site backups, as well as prompting the user to make backups by hand to USB, external media or even paper in some cases.
