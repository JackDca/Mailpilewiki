Filters are a generic mechanism for automatically adding or removing [[Tags]]
to messages that have just been discovered.

Some of the Mailpile default behaviors (flagging messages unread or
placing in the inbox) are implemented using filters that are configured
by the `--setup` command.

**FIXME:** Describe filters in more detail.

This document needs to be fleshed out. In the meantime, please see
`help filter` in the CLI, or check out `mailpile/plugins/filters.py` in
the source.
