### Which device would you recommend for us to use to enable maximum privacy? 

This question might take a while to answer. In the meantime, check out Security In a Box. It's a good start!

### Do you think that I  could resell your service in Russia?

Feel free!

### Where is your blog's RSS button!?!?!?!

### Will the Alpha build in Jan  2014 be an open Alpha? Will we be allowed to install, use, and give feed back around that time?

Absolutely. The Alpha release will require a bit of tech knowledge and use the command line to get up and running. The beta (April 2014) will be much easier.
