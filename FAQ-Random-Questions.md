### Is Mailpile real?

Yes, and so are we!

### Where is your blog's RSS button!?!?!?!

Good question. Here it is: <http://www.mailpile.is/blog/index.rss>

### Can we use Mailpile as the standard mail solution for our clients/company/server?

When Mailpile is ready, that should be an option, yes. But when is software ever ready?

### How do I get updates about your project?

We have an IRC channel on Freenode, `#mailpile`. This is the easiest to get hold of us and ask questions. Otherwise you can [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MailpileTeam).

We'll probably also add a mailing list one of these days... ;-)
