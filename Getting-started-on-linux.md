1. Clone Mailpile to a local directory: `git clone https://github.com/pagekite/Mailpile.git`
2. `cd Mailpile`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You may need to `sudo` this. If you don't have pip, go get that first.
4. `./mp`  -- at which point Mailpile should start.

That's it. Now [[go and configure Mailpile|Configuring Mailpile]]!
