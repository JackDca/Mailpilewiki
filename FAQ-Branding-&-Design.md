### Does Mailpile allow me to customize my install with a company logo, colors, font?

Yes. We have been developing Mailpile to support this sort of functionality.

### You used bad words in your video and I didn't like it.

We apologize you took offensive to some of our branding and creative choices, we were just trying to have fun.

### I don't like your design, logo, font, layout, haircut.

That is very sad, taste is subjective :(
    
### I really liked your design, logo, font, layout, haircut.

Cheers, so do we :)

### Why didn't you use a more modern color palate?

We thought more natural tones would humanize the user experience and make complicated things like encryption and email more user friendly.

### Your font looks a bit fuzzy in my browser

Our font is currently still being developed. Currently, the "bold" weight is being generated in the browser, this is not a good way to do things (and looks really terrible in FireFox). Once we finish creating an actually bold weight webfont this will improve dramatically. The "mailpile" font will be released under a fully open & free license- the SIL Open Font License (OFL)
