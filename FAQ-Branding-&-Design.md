### Does Mailpile allow me to customize my install with a company logo, colors, font?

Yes. We have been developing Mailpile to support this sort of functionality.

### You used bad words in your video and i didn't like it.

We apologize you took offensive to some of our branding and creative choices, we were just trying to have fun.

### I don't like your design, logo, font, layout, haircut.

That is very sad, taste is subjective :(
    
### I really liked your design, logo, font, layout, haircut.

Cheers, so do we :)

### Why didn't you use a more modern color palate?

We thought more natural tones would humanize the user experience and make complicated things like encryption and email more user friendly.

### Your font looks a bit fuzzy in my browser

Our font is currently still being developed and released under a fully open & free license- the SIL Open Font License (OFL)
