### What is Mailpile? Is it an email service?

Mailpile is an email client used for encrypting/decrypting emails and not an email service. Mailpile does currently not issue its own email accounts/addresses. You can use your existing email address on top of Mailpile. If your existing email service stores your emails on  their servers, then they will not be able to read the encrypted emails. The Mailpile client is used for sending/receiving, managing, organizing and storing emails on your computer/USB/cloud. 

### Is Mailpile real?

Yes, and so are we!

### Is Mailpile ready yet?

We launched an Alpha version for developers and advanced techies on Feb 1st 2014. A more user friendly Beta should be ready by late spring. Our 1.0 release will be in late summer 2014. For further details, check out our [blog](https://mailpile.is/blog/).

### Can we use Mailpile as the standard mail solution for our clients/company/server?

When Mailpile is ready, that should be an option, yes.

### How can I get a MailPile account?

There is no such thing! Mailpile is software you run on your computer, not an e-mail service provider. So you can just use the e-mail addresses you have already, or sign up for a new one somewhere.

### Can I get a cool @mailpile.is email address?

No, unfortunately those are currently only for our core team members & company. This may change in the future, or it may not. Absolutely no promises on this!

### Can I still Donate?

Yes, we would love for you to [support us](https://mailpile.is/donate/).

### Is Mailpile always going to be free?

Yes, it is a free and open software. However, to live in the current global economy, one has to have money to exchange for food. If you like it, [please consider donating](https://mailpile.is/donate/).

### Is there a mailing list so I can follow on your work?

Not yet, but this is a good idea! We will think about it.

### How do I get updates about your project?

We have an IRC channel on Freenode, #mailpile. This is the easiest to get hold of us and ask questions. Otherwise you can follow us on Twitter. Maybe in the future we'll consider having a mailing list. 

### Regarding accessibility, what happens when my computer is offline?

When the computer (laptop, desktop, webserver) you run your Mailpile from is offline, your Mailpile instance is no longer usable.
