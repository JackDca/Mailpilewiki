### Is Mailpile real?

Yes, and so are we!

### Is Mailpile ready yet?

We launched an Alpha version for developers and advanced techies on Feb 1st 2014. A more user friendly Beta should be ready by late spring. Our 1.0 release will be in late summer 2014. For further details, check out our [blog](https://mailpile.is/blog/).

### Can we use Mailpile as the standard mail solution for our clients/company/server?

When Mailpile is ready, that should be an option, yes.

### How can I get a MailPile account?

There is no such thing! Mailpile is software you run on you computer, not an e-mail service provider. So you can just use the e-mail addresses you have already, or sign up for a new one somewhere.

### Can I get a cool @mailpile.is email address?

No, unfortunately those are currently only for our core team members & company. This may change in the future, or it may not. Absolutely no promises on this!

### Can I still Donate?

Yes, we would love for you to [support us](https://mailpile.is/donate/).

### Is Mailpile always going to be free?

Yes, it is a free and open software. However, to live in the current global economy, one has to have money to exchange for food. If you like it, [please consider donating](https://mailpile.is/donate/).

### Is there a mailing list so I can follow on your work?

Not yet, but this is a good idea! We will think about it.

### How do I get updates about your project?

We have an IRC channel on Freenode, #mailpile. This is the easiest to get hold of us and ask questions. Otherwise you can follow us on Twitter. Maybe in the future we'll consider having an email address. 

### Regarding accessibility, what happens when my computer is offline?

When the computer (laptop, desktop, webserver) you run your Mailpile from is offline, your Mailpile instance is no longer usable.
