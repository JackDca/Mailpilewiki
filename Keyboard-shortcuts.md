Mailpile has built in keyboard shortcuts. We use keychains, so sometimes multi-key combos will get you results you're looking for.

When listing shortcuts, if we say "ctrl+c" it means "hold down ctrl and press c", but if we say "c b" it means "press c and then press b". So "+" implies simultaneity, whereas a space implies consecutiveness.
