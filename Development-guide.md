New to Mailpile development? Want to contribute? Thinking of writing a plugin? Read on...

## Writing plugins
* Look at the [[Plugin API]]
* Look at existing plugins

## Committing to Mailpile core
* Come hang out on our IRC channel - introduce yourself. It's easier to get into things if you chat with us. :-)
* If you're a backend developer, go read mailpile/app.py, mailpile/command.py and mailpile/ui.py at the very least. Take note of the "session" and "config" objects that are floating about. They're very central.
* If you're a frontend developer, familiarize yourself with the [[Commands]] structure and the Jinja2 templating engine. Then visit [[Themes]]
